# CONTRACT.XYZ
Welcome to Contract.xyz, a hackathon project aimed at solving the issues of trust in the tech community, specifically for developers and individuals with soft skills. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and how to get started with the smart contracts that power Contract.xyz.

## Overview
Contract.xyz is designed to address the trust deficit often encountered by developers showcasing their skills on platforms like GitHub, Twitter, or other social media. Despite displaying their skills, recruiters often need additional assurance that the individuals they are recruiting are legitimate and not scammers.

To solve this, Contract.xyz leverages the ZKYC feature from zkPass. This platform allows individuals to sign agreements using their wallet addresses. Contract.xyz then uses ZKYC to fetch and verify their KYC details from trusted platforms like Binance, providing an additional layer of trust.
